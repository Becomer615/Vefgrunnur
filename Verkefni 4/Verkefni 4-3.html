He didn't notice that the lights had changed<br>
A crowd of people stood and stared<br>
They'd seen his face before<br>
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords</P>
<div>
<p><h2>Allt um litafræði</h2><br>
Dragged a comb across my head<br>
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup<br>
And looking up, I noticed I was late</P>

<p>I read the news today, oh boy<br>
About a lucky man who made the grade<br>
And though the news was rather sad<br>
Well, I just had to laugh<br>
I saw the photograph</P>
<div>
<p>Found my coat and grabbed my hat<br>
Made the bus in seconds flat<br>
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke<br>
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream</P>

<section class="aside2"><p><h2>Aside>2.</h2><br>
The English army had just won the war<br>
A crowd of people turned away<br>
But I just had to look<br>
Having read the book</P>

<div>
<p>Ah I read the news today, oh boy<br>
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire<br>
And though the holes were rather small<br>
They had to count them all<br>
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall</P>
